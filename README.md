# AutoPlaySoccerStreams
AutoPlay, Remove Ads &amp; Annoying Stuff on the majority of Reddit SoccerStream's Streams.

This script also tries to remove the automatic redirection when you open the Stream's iframe in a new window by using MutationObserver's API and replacing the website JS code.

Firefox can easily bypass website's right-click limitations by pressing Shift while right-clicking on the player.
If the player is indeed in an iframe you can right-click, press This frame > Open in a new tab.
